He cursed the captain for considering using his soldiers in such a way– a unit of hobgoblins was formidable against enemy armies, but against a small and experienced team of experts, Ivlom knew his soldier’s usual tactics would work against them. Surely enough, Ivlom’s enemies had used their speed, magic, and terrain to out-maneuver and wreak havoc among the hobgoblins, which lacked the diversity of fighting types to counter the enemy moves. None of the hobgoblins survived but Ivlom and the captain, and Ivlom knew that it was time for a change in leadership."

That day, they drank the last of their water, and several soldiers had already died of dehydration. Up ahead, Sukriye thought she could see some figures in the distance. It was probably a mirage or the heat exhaustion toying with Sukriye’s mind. Hope was a luxury she did not have."

Out came a behemoth of a man whom the duchess called “Jacre,” though in truth, the meddlers did not know if he was human. Standing over six and a half feet tall, clad in thick plate mail, and bearing a massive steel shield, he must have weighed over four hundred pounds. Jacre knew it was not his place to question what the meddlers might be doing. His ward, the duchess, was in danger, and having saved him from a life of slavery, he owed her everything. Onward Jacre rushed, rojectiles aimed for the dutchess deflected harmlessly by Jacre’s armor. The meddlers were so focused on the charging behemoth that they forgot about the archers, who opened fire on them. Jacre felt good about his odds in this battle, but even if they turned against him he would make sure the fight was not a short one; giving the duchess time to escape."
